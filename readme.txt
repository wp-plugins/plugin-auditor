The Plugin Auditor plugin records details of who installed and activated each plugin on your website and why.

== Description ==

Have you ever had that situation where you have a bunch of plugins installed and you can't remember why half of them are there?  

It is important to clean out unused plugins and keep your plugins up to date, but this can be difficult if you have forgotten why you installed them in the first place.  This is particularly true for sites with multiple admin users, and for agencies that manage their clients sites.

You don't want to delete an old plugin without being 100% sure why it was installed and therefore know if it is still needed. 

The Plugin Auditor tells you why each plugin was installed and also keeps a record of who installed it so that you know who to ask if you have any questions when performing maintenance on the site.

== Installation ==

The Plugin Auditor plugin is really plug and play.  Just upload the plugin and activate.
1. Upload `plugin-audit.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
To view the logs of plugin activity on your site, simply go to Plugins > Audit.
